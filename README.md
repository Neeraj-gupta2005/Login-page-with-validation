Login Page with JavaScript Validation
This repository contains a simple login page implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The login page includes client-side validation for both the password strength and the presence of a username before allowing the user to log in. Additionally, it features a password visibility toggle.

Features
Password Strength Indicator: The page evaluates the strength of the entered password and provides visual feedback to the user, indicating whether the password is weak, normal, or strong.

Username Validation: The login button is disabled if the username field is empty. An error message is displayed if the user attempts to log in without entering a username.

Password Visibility Toggle: Users can toggle the visibility of the entered password by tapping on the side lock icon next to the password input field.

Icon Integration: The login page connects to an external website to fetch and display icons, enhancing the visual appeal of the user interface.

Files
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the login page.
styles.css: The CSS file responsible for styling the login page.
script.js: The JavaScript file that implements the password strength indicator, username validation, password visibility toggle, and icon integration.
