# Login Page with JavaScript Validation

This repository contains a simple login page implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The login page includes client-side validation for both the password strength and the presence of a username before allowing the user to log in. Additionally, it features a password visibility toggle and connects to a website for using icons.

## Features

- **Password Strength Indicator:** The page evaluates the strength of the entered password and provides visual feedback to the user, indicating whether the password is weak, normal, or strong.

- **Username Validation:** The login button is disabled if the username field is empty. An error message is displayed if the user attempts to log in without entering a username.

- **Password Visibility Toggle:** Users can toggle the visibility of the entered password by tapping on the side lock icon next to the password input field.

- **Icon Integration:** The login page connects to an external website to fetch and display icons, enhancing the visual appeal of the user interface.
